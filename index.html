                            This is often used to depict the layout of a building, showing locations of rooms and windows, walls, doors, stairs etc. Although plan drawings can be drawn from above, they are often drawn cutting through the building with horizontal plane.

                            A callout is an area within the plan that is drawn at a larger scale. For example, if I have a floor plan at 1/4″ = 1'-0″ scale of a house, I might have a callout of the kitchen and bathrooms, showing them at 1/2″ = 1'-0″ scale. Half inch scale is twice as large as quarter inch scale

                            A site plan may or may not be drawn cutting through the building. A site plan is going to show more than just the building, including the entire site the building is located on. This can show the property lines, the building location, utilities, roads, landscape etc.
